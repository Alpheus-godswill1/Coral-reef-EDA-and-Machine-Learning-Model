# Coral Reef Health Forecasting - Florida Keys

This project uses historical data from the Coral Reef Evaluation and Monitoring Project (CREMP) to analyze and forecast coral reef health in the Florida Keys. Leveraging machine learning models, we assess trends in stony coral and octocoral species, examining regional variation, ecological decline, and potential recovery trajectories.

## Features

- 📊 Exploratory data analysis of stony coral and octocoral species
- 🌎 Regional comparisons across Lower, Middle, and Upper Keys
- 🔁 Time series analysis of coral density, LTA, and cover
- 🤖 Machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost) for forecasting coral health
- 📈 5-year ecological outlooks based on historical trends
- 📍 Station-level and subregion-level insights

## Datasets Used

- `CREMP_Pcover_2023_StonyCoralSpecies.csv`
- `CREMP_Stations_2023.csv`
- `CREMP_SCOR_RawData_2023.csv`
- `CREMP_OCTO_Summaries_2023_Density.csv`
- `CREMP_OCTO_Summaries_2023_MeanHeight.csv`
